# YOUR TASK: 3D Visualizations of Sightings & Historical Events

From major historical UFO/UAP events explored through stunning 3D visualizations mapping not only the established event chronology but user contributed sightings across the globe.

Picture an interactive world map where you can zoom in and out, explore sightings by location, and navigate through time using a dynamic slider that showcases how these phenomena have evolved over the decades. Heatmaps will highlight regions with high densities of sightings, and for those who love immersive experiences, augmented reality features will let you visualize historical sightings in your current surroundings.

Each event isnâ€™t just a pinpoint on a map; it comes alive with detailed descriptions, eyewitness accounts, official reports, and multimedia elements like photos, videos, and audio recordings. Users can dive deep into geospatial data, view satellite imagery, and even add their own annotations, forking the master narrative and proposing their own interpretations for review or for fun. The exploration is informative and interactive.

Keeping up with the latest developments is crucial, and Ultraterrestrial excels in status reporting on claims, hearings, news items, and events. A real-time dashboard offers an overview of recent developments, ongoing investigations, and upcoming events. Imagine visual timelines tracking the progression of key claims and hearings, complemented by a notification system that keeps you updated on specific topics or events you care about most.

## UPDATED TASK

Ensure Sightings and Events 3D Globe Visualization implements a 3D globe visualization with:

1. Animated map markers
2. Elegant subtle cluster UI for sightings density
3. Animated 3D Arc trajectory UI for sequential or time series events or sightings along with a corresponding scroll to or fly to rotation on the 3D globe

**Questions and considerations**
 How to handle large sightings data set?

- CSV?
- database query?
